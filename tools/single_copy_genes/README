to extract all human protein ids:
grep ENS journal.pcbi.1002269.s010.txt | cut -d" " -f 3  | sed 's/9606.//g' > human_proteins.txt

But this doesn't work, because some  - at least the ones tested - used ensembl IDs are retired.

Check all TreeFam families for presence of genes in X organims.

1. save all gene_tree_root_ids in /helper_files/XYZ
2. run with

	./run_all.sh

3. it outputs a list of sql-insert commands that go into table "xrefID2Family"
